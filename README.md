# page-builder: sample HTML Templates

Templates in page-builder require a header and a footer. These are separated into two files in this repository, so you'll need to open them both and copy and paste both sets of code to create the templates.

- **Simple Template** - a simple template with almost the absolute minimum. This is useful for testing whether an issue is due to your template or something else, or for beginning templates from scratch. The files are in this repository: [Header](https://github.com/EngagingNetworks/page-builder-templates/blob/master/simple-template-header.html) and [Footer](https://github.com/EngagingNetworks/page-builder-templates/blob/master/simple-template-footer.html)

- **Ecommerce** - for our eCommerce page types. There is a header, footer, and import file.
