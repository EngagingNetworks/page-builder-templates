# page-builder: sample HTML Templates

Templates in page-builder require a header and a footer. These are separated into two files in this repository, so you'll need to open them both and copy and paste both sets of code to create the templates.

So far there is only one template here, but more will be added soon.

- **Simple Template** - a template with almost the absolute minimum. This is useful for testing whether an issue is due to your template or something else
- **Styled Template** - 4Site have developed a template that can be easily updated with your own logo and colours
